# Overview
In this project, we will implement a convolution and pooling layer. First, we apply the DoG (Difference of Gaussians) filter to the 'lena.png' image. Next, we employ Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding on the filter's output, and then feed this encoded image into a Spiking Neural Network. In the next layer, we apply a 2x2 max pooling operation.
