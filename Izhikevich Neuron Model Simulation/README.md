# Izhikevich Neuron Model Simulation
## Overview
The Izhikevich neuron model is a powerful and computationally efficient alternative to the Hodgkin and Huxley model for simulating neuronal behavior. It is designed to capture a wide range of neuronal firing patterns while prioritizing simulation speed. Below, I will provide you with the core equations and explanations of the key parameters of the Izhikevich neuron model:
### Core Equations
1. **Membrane Potential (V):** This is the primary variable representing the neuron's membrane potential. It evolves according to the following differential equation:
