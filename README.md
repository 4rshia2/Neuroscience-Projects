# Neuroscience-Projects
These are my projects during my Computational Neuroscience  Course.

In these Project I have used **Pymonntorch** Library for my Implementations.

The sources of Library can be downloaded from the [CNRL Github](https://github.com/cnrl/pymonntorch).

you can either clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git://github.com/cnrl/pymonntorch
```
Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

$ python setup.py install
```
